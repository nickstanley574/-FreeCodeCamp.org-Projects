# Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Markdown Previewer

**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO. Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
    
    
- [x] User Story #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".
- [x] User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".
- [x] User Story #3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
- [x] User Story #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I typeHINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can impxrt the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).
- [x] User Story #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), axsub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
- [x] User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.
- [x] Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).
- [x] Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
    
* You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js
* Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.
